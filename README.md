### Hello friend 👋
DevOps Engineer working daily with AWS, Terraform, and Docker. I’m passionate about streamlining the path from local development to production — with a strong focus on automation and reliability. I enjoy automating repetitive or boring tasks, and I also work on personal projects using Symfony (PHP), Nuxt.js (Vue), and TailwindCSS.

On my free time, I read a lot of articles, contribute to open-source projects, and train myself in new technologies. Sometimes I also write on [my blog](https://www.duboiss.fr/blog).

## Some of my open-source projects
[SymForum](https://github.com/DuboisS/SymForum), an "old school" forum using Symfony. I try to keep it as up-to-date as possible and add new features from time to time.

[SymPriceAlert](https://github.com/duboiss/SymPriceAlert), a price alerter. Enter the products you wish to "track" and be notified as soon as they reach the desired price by the way of your choice (email, sms...).
